All of the pages will be comnmented, the index.html file will be the most commented, with any new JAVA, HTML or CSS code on any of the other pages commented also.

Login Page Sadly due to time constrainghts the login page could not be made fully operational, i.e the page isnt encrpted with SSH or https, but if more time was added to the project, or this was going to be a live site,
the page would have these features added to the project. Also within the login page thier would be another option to create an account

Products page Sadly due to time constraights the actual products page does not let the user add the roses to the basket, as thier is not a basket, I think if a little time was added to the project deadline, a basket would definately been added probably using the paypal shopping cart I also fully understand that the products page is very lacking in its content, but sadly this was the 

About Us page, sadly thier wasnt enough time to also implement the auto change of the map found within the abous us page.
